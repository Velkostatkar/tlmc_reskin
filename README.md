Put more:
Open tlmc_reskin/stream/tlmclogo.ytd open and edit tlmclogo.ytd by OpenIV

put in some of your favorite .png or TLMCEXAMPLE.dds save and close. (remember name you will need it later. For example: TLMCEXAMPLE.dds)
Grab tlmclogo.ytd from OpenIV, and move it back to tlmc_reskin/stream/ and replace

Enjoy
